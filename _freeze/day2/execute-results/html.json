You all have different levels of knowledge and experience with data analysis and programming, and there is hopefully something in the exercises that will stretch everyone no matter what their background!\n\nSo make a good effort at the tutorial and the exercises, work together and use extra resources if needed (part of the skill is knowing where to go for help), but don't spend more than half a day on this unless you want to!\n\n:::\n\n## The dataset\n\nThe data are from a randomised clinical trial of a new rehabilition intervention (compared to standard care) aimed at improving the walking speed of people recovering from stroke. \n\nBetter walking speed is a good indicator of general stroke recovery.\n\nWe have recorded:\n\n* The age and sex of each participant,\n* The treatment allocation,\n* The hospital department from which they were recruited and\n* Time they take to complete a walking task after their treatment.\n\nOur research questions are:\n\n* Does the new treatment improve walking speed compared to control treatment?\n* By how much does it improve, and how certain are we of this?\n\nThe dataset can be found at [walkingspeed_day2.xlsx](./walkingspeed_day2.xlsx)\n\n* Powerpoint slides to support this material are at:\n\n[Graphing - day3.pptx](./day3.pptx)\n\n[day3_data_lm.pptx](./day3_data_lm.pptx)\n\n# Using `readxl` to read data from Excel files\n\nR is not used for data entry or storage; you are likely to have data stored as an Excel file, a csv file, in a database, or in some other format generated by a device.\n\nSo before we can do any analysis we need to import data.  We do this in code like everything else in R.\n\nBase R cannot read data from Excel files.  But several add-on ‘packages’ *can* read and write Excel files.  Currently the best package for reading Excel files is called `readxl`.  For writing Excel files the `openxlsx` package is very good.\n\nWhatever the format your raw data there is likely to be a package to read it into R:\n\n* `readxl` for Excel format\n* `haven` for other statistics packages (Stata, SPSS etc)\n* `readr` or `data.table` for csv and plain text\n* `pzfx` for GraphPad Prism.\n* Various `Bioconductor` packages for 'omics data in various formats. \n\nHere we will import a dataset from Excel using the `readxl` package.  If you already installed `tidyverse` then you already have this package.  \n\nOnce the package is installed we can use the function `readxl::read_excel()`, which reads data from an Excel file.\n\n## Make sure the data looks OK and is in the right place on your computer\n\nBefore we dive in and import it, we need to make sure our data is in a sensible place.\n\n1. Open RStudio and switch to the project you created in day 1, or start a new project if necessary.\n\n2. Then, save the example data [`walkingspeed_day2.xlsx`](`walkingspeed_day2.xlsx`) for this tutorial into your project folder.  Check that it has appeared in the 'files' pane in RStudio.\n\n3. Start a new script file that will eventually include all of the commands we need to import, clean, visualise and analyse the data.\n\n4. Now open the dataset in Excel and explore the file so that you understand what is there.\n\n## Read the help!\n\nWe are nearly ready to import our data.  But before using a new function its always good to read its documentation.\n\nR and R packages are not as self-explanatory as other software, and so you should expect to spend a fair amount of time, particularly as you are learning R, reading documentation, vignettes, blogs, etc on what R can do, which packages exist, and how to use them.\n\nThe `read_excel()` function has a few different options so first we should look at the help file:\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\n?read_excel # where does the helpfile appear?\n```\n:::\n\n\nMake sure to check: \n\n* **Description** what does the function do,\n* **Usage** what is the syntax\n* **Arguments** detail of what all the options mean\n* **Value** what do I get when I run this\n* **Examples** (usually very helpful)\n\nNote from the help file that `read_excel()` can extract data from different sheets and ranges of an Excel workbook, can use or ignore column names, and allows you to specify the type of data (numeric, dates, text etc) if you want to, or leave it to R to guess.\n\nMany R packages also have vignettes or websites including simpler guides to their use in specific cases.  `readxl` has a website that you might find helpful:  [https://readxl.tidyverse.org/](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/)\n\nNow we’ll load the data.  We want to use the ‘walking speed’ data from the walkingspeed.xlsx spreadsheet. \n\n5. Open the spreadsheet using Excel and find this sheet.  The data we want is in the sheet called 'day2'.\n\nFrom the `read_excel()` help file we can deduce the syntax to load this data into R:\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nwalkingdat <- read_excel(path=\"walkingspeed_day2.xlsx\", sheet=\"day2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis line assumes that the file `walkingspeed_day2.xlsx` is in the current working directory (you can check what the current working directory is with `getwd()`.  The current working directory is also shown just above the R console window.  You can see the files in the current working directory in the 'Files' tab on the bottom right of the RStudio window.  When you create or load a project RStudio will set the working directory to the root of the project directory.\n\nSo this line calls the `read_excel()` function, with the arguments `path`, `sheet` set.  The other arguments will be set to their default values, which you can see from the help file.  \n\nWe could have set the range of the data in the spreadsheet (I usually do this for safety), but `read_excel()` can figure it out automatically most of the time; by default it picks the biggest continuous chunk of data starting in the top left of the sheet.\n\nNow you should have a ‘data frame’ object called `walkingdat` in your environment, which includes the data from the Excel sheet ready to process and analyse.\n\nOur workflow now is:\n\n1. Clean and code\n2. Visualise\n3. Describe\n4. Model\n5. Diagnose model\n6. Interpret\n\n\n# Cleaning\n\nBefore we can analyse our data we should check each variable to make sure that it looks OK.\n\nWe'll use functions from day 1 to explore the content and structure of the dataset, and the distributions of the main variables.  We can then address any problems that we find.\n\nRecall these functions from the day 1 notes.  We are checking that the variables have the correct type, and the distributions of the categorical variables.  \n\nThis is an important aspect of any data analysis and we should not skip this step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nsummary(walkingdat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     patid           group                time             sex           \n Min.   :  1.00   Length:135         Min.   :  0.000   Length:135        \n 1st Qu.: 34.50   Class :character   1st Qu.:  2.167   Class :character  \n Median : 68.00   Mode  :character   Median :  2.426   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 68.01                      Mean   :  4.175                     \n 3rd Qu.:101.50                      3rd Qu.:  2.949                     \n Max.   :136.00                      Max.   :185.362                     \n     age              department   \n Length:135         Min.   :1.000  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Mode  :character   Median :3.000  \n                    Mean   :2.607  \n                    3rd Qu.:3.500  \n                    Max.   :4.000  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(walkingdat$age)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(walkingdat$group)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\ncontrol   treat \n     68      67 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(walkingdat$sex)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n  F   M \n 35 100 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(walkingdat$department)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n 1  2  3  4 \n28 31 42 34 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Converting between types\n\nYou will have noticed that one of the numerical variables, age, has been loaded as character variable and not a numeric.

What does it mean?\n\n## Checking the data\n\nWe mustn't assume that all our data had been entered correctly.\n\nHow might we check on the age and time variables to see if the distribution looks OK?\n\nWe could make some descriptive statistics and basic plots!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(walkingdat$age)\nhist(walkingdat$time)\nrange(walkingdat$time, na.rm=TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat do you notice from here?\n\n## Dealing with outliers\n\nIt looks like there are some unreasonably high and low values of walking time.  \n\nWe can make another graph of walking speed against age, this time on a logarithmic scale so both the extreme high and extreme low points are visible, to see what is going on.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## ggplot2 version\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(walkingdat) + aes(x=age, y=time) + geom_point() + scale_y_log10()\n\n## base R version\nplot(walkingdat$age, walkingdat$time, log=\"y\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt seems there are some values for time that are likely to be technical errors.  We can remove these values (set them to missing) in a few different ways:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## base R method\nwalkingdat$time[walkingdat$time<0.1] <- NA\nwalkingdat$time[walkingdat$time>100] <- NA\n\n## Using mutate and ifelse\nwalkingdat <- walkingdat |> mutate(time = ifelse(time<0.1,NA,time))\nwalkingdat <- walkingdat |> mutate(time = ifelse(time>100,NA,time))\n\n## the 'pure' tidyverse way with case_when is a bit clunky.\n## look up 'case_when()' to understand this line\nwalkingdat <- walkingdat |> mutate( time = case_when(time<0.1 ~ NA_real_ , \n                                                     time>100 ~ NA_real_, \n                                                     TRUE ~ time) )\n\n# Now check the distribution of time again.\nhist(walkingdat$time, breaks=100)\nrange(walkingdat$time, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we have a cleaned dataset in our environment you can proceed with our visualization and analysis, using the functions you learned in day 1.\n\nIf you had trouble with the cleaning exercise then use the version of the dataset found in the `cleaned` tab of the spreadsheet:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwalkingdat <- read_excel(path=\"walkingspeed_day2.xlsx\", sheet=\"cleaned\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Analysis - Exercises\n\n\nAdd commands to your script file to answer the questions below.  \n\nAdd comments (lines beginning with `#`) to help you remember which questions you are answering, what you did and why!.\n\nSome solutions are posted at the bottom of the page, but it will help you a lot to try to answer them on your own, by discussing with colleagues, or by looking up help online before using the solutions.\n\nIf you don't understand the given solution, then please ask and we can go through it in the class.\n\nWe will discuss the testing, modelling and graphing elements in more detail on day 3, but it would be helpful to attempt these today.\n\n---\n\n1. Structure of the dataset\n    a. What are the names of the variables that comprise the `walkingdata` dataframe?\n    a. What is the class of each?\n    a. How many columns and rows does it have?\n\n1. Descriptive statistics\n    a. What is the age of youngest patient? \n    a. What is the age of the oldest patient? \n    a. Are the oldest and youngest patient male or female?\n\n1. Cross-tabulation (hint, use the `table` function)\n    a. How many Male and Female patients are there?\n    a. Is the sex ratio balanced between treatment groups?\n    a. How many women are there of age under 50? How many men are there of age under 50?\n\n1.  Descriptive statistics using a subset of the data\n    a. What is the average walking speed for men between 50 and 60 years of age?\n\n1.  Graphing\n    a. Consider what kind of graph you might make to illustrate the difference in walking speed between treatment groups, and try to make it using ggplot. Eg:\n    a. Make a scatter plot of time vs age\n    a. Make the colour of each point reflect the treatment group\n    a. Make a box plot of time by sex, with a different coloured box per sex\n    a. Label the axes appropriately\n    a. Try a violin plot instead of a boxplot (with geom_violin).  Which do you prefer?\n    a. Make any other adjustments you think are informative!\n\n1.  Hypothesis Testing\n    a. What is the difference in average walking speed between control patients and treated patients?\n    a. Is this difference statistically significant? Use t-test `t.test()` and Mann-Whitney tests `wilcox.test()` to examine the differences between the groups.  Look up the syntax for `t.test()` and `wilcox.test()` using the help system, and use them to check whether the time taken to complete the task varies by treatment status.  In each case use the version of the function that takes a `formula` agument. Remember the `formula` syntax from the `boxplot` and `lm` functions in day 1.\n    a. Compare the p-values for each method.\n    a. Consider the assumptions for a t-test, and whether they are met in this dataset.  \n    a. Do you believe that treatment affects walking speed?\n\n1.  Deriving new variables\n    a. Create a new column that will have the speed of walking, that is 1/time.\n    a. Create a new column that will have the time rounded up to nearest 10th of a second.\n\n1.  Linear model diagnostics\n    a. Estimate a linear model (with `lm`) to estimate/test the effect of treatment on task completion time.\n    a. Use `summary` to get the model coefficients and p-values\n    a. Use `broom::tidy` to get the model coefficients and p-values\n    a. Compare the model results to the equivalent t-test\n    a. Extend the model to include the effects of age and sex as potential covariates.\n    a. Use `plot()` to explore the model diagnostics\n    a. Use `performance::check_model` to explore the model diagnostics\n    a. Now estimate a new model to compare the task completion speed between groups.\n    a. Get the model coefficients and p-values\n    a. Check the model diagnostics using `plot` or `performance::check_model`\n    a. Why are the result from this model different?  How do you interpret the results?\n    a. Can you get the confidence intervals for the treatment effect (use the help for `broom::tidy`)\n    a. Use `model_summary` package to make a pretty model summary table\n\n\n# Solutions\n\nThe exercises will have many possible solutions, under each exercise we have listed a few possible answers.  Most are possible using the functions we have introduced in day 1 of the course, or with functions I suggest in the questions, but in some cases there are other solutions that I have given using different functions/packages.\n\nIf you answered the questions another way then that's fine, but do try to understand how the given solutions work.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_knit$set(eval=FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Structure of the dataset\n\nWhat are the names of the variables that comprise the `walkingdat` dataframe?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Eg you could use:\nstr(walkingdat)\nnames(walkingdat)\nsummary(walkingdat)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat is the class of each?
