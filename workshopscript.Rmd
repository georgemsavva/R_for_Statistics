# Introduction

This page supports a short workshop in R and RStudio for Statistics.  It is not intended as a comprehensive tutorial but as a vehicle for demonstrating and discussing some aspects of a typical analysis  using R, with signposting in the lecture notes for further self-directed learning.

A simple dataset is introduced along with some research questions and I demonstrate a typical process of loading, visualising, cleaning, analysing and reporting the analysis.  The workshop will very briefly introduce:

* the RStudio interface
* sources of help 
* using projects and scripts
* basics of the R language
* loading data from excel
* tidy data
* the tidyverse and data.table systems for data wrangling
* merging and appending datasets
* running a R function with named arguments
* the formula interface
* how to estimate a linear models
* ggplot

Supporting material (presentation slides, dataset) is linked.  

A more detailed R tutorial is also available on this site.

# Background to the dataset

We have an Excel spreadsheet with data corresponding to a rehabilitation intervention for stroke patients.  

Hospital patients were recruited from five hospital departments and were randomised to either standard care or an experimental treatment.  The time they took to complete a walking speed task was recorded as the outcome.  A lower time corresponds to a better outcome.

The dataset is here [walkingspeed.xlsx](./walkingspeed.xlsx): 
A R script including only the R command needed for the analysis is here: [workshopscript.R](./workshopscript.R): 

We will answer the following questions:

* What is the mean and standard deviation of walking speed in each treatment group?
* Does the treatment improve walking speed?
* Is the treatment effect different between men and women?

Our workflow is typical of most staistical analyses:

* Load data
* Wrangle
* Describe
* Visualise
* Clean and recode
* Test and model
* Report

# Set up

We will need to install the libraries below if we don't already have them.  We should also start a new project in the project directory, and download the data and the code if necessary.

```{r }

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(readxl)

```

# Load data

We should inspect the data in Excel.  Note there are three sheets that we need to combine to do our analysis.  

Review the "tidy data" powerpoint presentation here: [day2_tidydata.pptx](./day2_tidydata.pptx).

```{r }
treated <- read_excel(path="walkingspeed.xlsx", 
                      sheet = "treated",
                      range = "A1:B68")
```

Notes:

* The library readxl for reading Excel sheets.  There are alternatives but I find this works well.
* Multiline function call
* Named arguments
* Assigning the outcome to the variable
* Help file, how did we know how this function worked.

We need to load all three sheets as separate data frames.

```{r }
control <- read_excel(path="walkingspeed.xlsx", 
                      sheet = "control",
                      range = "A1:B70")

metadata <- read_excel(path="walkingspeed.xlsx", 
                      sheet = "meta",
                      range = "A1:D139")
```

# Explore data

R includes several functions to inspect data

```{r }
class(treated)
str(treated)
summary(treated)
head(treated)
# View(treated)
str(control)
```

Notes:

* Data can be numeric, character strings, (factors or logical)
* Do we know what each of these types is for?

# Access elements from the dataframe

```{r }
control$walktime
control$walktime[1]
control$walktime[1:10]
mean(control$walktime)
mean(control$walktime[1:5])

log(control$walktime)
log(control$walktime[1:5])

```

# Wrangle

For analysis we will need all the data into one data frame.  We need to append (row bind) the treatment and control results, then merge (join)  the meta data.

```{r }
# Remind ourselves of the structure of the dataset
str(treated)
str(control)
```

We need to make sure the vectors we are merging have the same type and name!

There are a lot of ways to do the same thing.  Here I am illustrating the 'base' R way, the 'tidyverse' way and the 'data.table' way to convert a new numeric variable from a character variable.

```{r }
# Base R
treated$walktime <- as.numeric(treated$time)

# data.table
setDT(treated)
treated[ , walktime := as.numeric(time)  ]

# tidyverse
treated <- treated %>% mutate(walktime = as.numeric(time))
```

Now we can append the rows and merge them with the metadata.  Again there is a `tidyverse` function for this, and a `data.table` function for this.

```{r }
# data.table
combined <- rbind(treated, control, fill=TRUE)
combined <- rbind(treated=treated, 
                  control=control, 
                  fill=TRUE, idcol="group")
# tidyverse
combined <- bind_rows(treated, control)
combined <- bind_rows(treated = treated, 
                      control = control, 
                      .id = "group")

str(metadata)
str(combined)

walkingdata <- merge(combined, metadata, 
                by.x = "patid", by.y = "patient")

head(walkingdata)
str(walkingdata)
summary(walkingdata)
```



# Describe

Our first task was to describe the mean and standard deviation of walking time by group.  There is no simple way to do this with base R.  Possible `tidyverse` and `data.table` approaches are shown below.  

```{r }
# Tidyverse
walkingdata %>% 
  filter(!is.na(walktime)) %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(Mean=mean(walktime), SD=sd(walktime))

# data.table
walkingdata[!is.na(walktime) ,  
            .(Mean=mean(walktime), SD=sd(walktime)),
            group]
```


# Visualise

Base R graphics are difficult to work with.  `ggplot2` provides an excellent system for graphing scientific data using R.  See the associated slides and flipbook.

```{r  }
# A very bad graph
plot(walkingdata$age , walkingdata$walktime)

# A better graph
ggplot(walkingdata) + 
  aes(x=age, y=walktime) + 
  geom_point()

# Adorn the graph
ggplot(walkingdata) + 
  aes(x=age, y=walktime) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x="Age (years)", y="Time (seconds)") + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(walkingdata) + 
  aes(x=group, y=walktime) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x="Treatment group", y="Time (seconds)") + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme_bw()
```
  

# Clean data

Our graphics suggest that there are some data points that are probably technical failures.  We should remove these.

```{r }
# base
walkingdata$walktime[ walkingdata$walktime > 100 ] <- NA
walkingdata$walktime[ walkingdata$walktime < 0.1 ] <- NA
# data.table
walkingdata[ walktime>100 , walktime := NA]
walkingdata[ walktime<0.1 , walktime := NA]
```

# Simple tests

Now we can conduct a simple statistical test of the walking speed across groups.  Note the 'formula' interface:

```{r }
t.test( data = walkingdata , walktime ~ group)
ttest1 <- t.test( data = walkingdata , walktime ~ group)
ttest1$p.value
```

What does this suggest about the treatment effectiveness?

# Model

This test ignores much of what we know about these participants, and may not be suitable.  A linear model is a better paradiagm for statistical analysis.  It allows us to build more complex analyses, and easily test our assumptions.

```{r }
lm1 <- lm( data = walkingdata , walktime ~ group)
summary(lm1)
confint(lm1)
```

# Diagnose

The diagnostics suggest something is wrong.  We can transform the data so that the assumptions of the model are met.

```{r }
plot(lm1)


walkingdata[ , speed := 1/walktime]

lm2 <- lm( data = walkingdata , log(walktime) ~ group)
lm3 <- lm( data = walkingdata , 1/walktime ~ group)
plot(lm2)
plot(lm3)

summary(lm3)
gtsummary::tbl_regression(lm3)
```

Is the interpretation different now?

# Augment model

We can develop the model by adding terms for age and department. We should always include these because they explain variance in the outcome measure.

```{r }
lm4 <- lm( data = walkingdata , 1/walktime ~ group + age + sex + department)
gtsummary::tbl_regression(lm4)

lm5 <- lm( data = walkingdata , 1/walktime ~ group + age + sex + factor(department))
gtsummary::tbl_regression(lm5)

anova(lm5 , update(lm5, . ~ . -age))
```

# Interactions

To test whether the treatment effect varies by sex we should test the `group*sex` interaction. 

```{r }
lm6 <- lm( data = walkingdata , 1/walktime ~ group*sex + age +  factor(department))

gtsummary::tbl_regression(lm6)

anova( lm5 , lm6 )
library(emmeans)
emmeans(lm6, pairwise ~ group | sex)

treatmentestimates <- as.data.frame(confint(emmeans(lm6, pairwise ~ group | sex)$contrast))
```{r }
g1 <- ggplot(treatmentestimates) + aes(x=sex, y=estimate, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(width=0.2) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x="Sex", y="Treatment effect") 
  
g1 
g1 + coord_flip()
```  

What does this suggest.  Does the treatment work in men and women?
